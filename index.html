                      goya will be built as an app meaning users will download the app onto their phones. it will be displayed as an social media app - however will actually be made as a kind of game that keeps the users in a loop of dark patterns until they manage to breakout / break the pattern. At the end if they manage to get out it will give them a summary of all the dark patterns they fell for and a score/ time frame of how long it took for them to get out.

                    Everyone. I want to see how many people can be misled and how long it takes for people to start thinking about what they are doing instead of subconsciously following/ trusting an app. I want this app to educate people without them realising they are being tricked. People will download the app for social media purposes and soon realise the intent of the app or get frustrated and give up.

                <p>My aim is to trick people into downloading an app that is filled with dark patterns and seeing how they react. I want to see how many people fall victim to these dark patterns. people will be able to see how obviously they are to these patterns and how easy it is to be tricked/ misled. 
				this will allow me to see how prone society is to giving their information away without knowing it</p><p>It will allow people to see how they can become the product of an app and show users the different types of dark patterns that exist.</p>

            	<p>looking into dark patterns i wanted to see how often people are influenced / effected by these and how easily people can fall victim to these patterns build to make people sub cousinly do things without thinking. 
				 <br><br>I am mainly looking into colour psychology, misdirecting,trick questions, collecting peoples information and seeing how people trust visually appealing/professionally designed apps.
            	<br><br>
            	Looking into the topic of  Metrics and Monetisation I wanted to see how easily people fall for these dark patterns and how aware society is about what is going on behind the scenes of these social networking apps. 
            	<br><br>
            	My app will be able to monitor how many dark patterns people fall for. It will go through mulitple generic dark patterns and see if users are able to pick up on them or simply keep following throup the never ending loop of steps. This will give insight into how people use their devices and how aware or obviously people are to whats happening behind products.
